    about: `Hello! My name is Seth Davis, and I've been writing software and games since High School, beginning work at Bytelion in my senior year. In Bytelion I found myself comfortable in the developer role, as I worked with a variety of teams in a variety of projects. I learned languages like Ruby on Rails, and how to manage entire PostgreSQL databases like the massive database attractions within Argo. After becoming accepted to UMBC, I found myself involved in the UMBC Game Developerâ€™s Club, where I was able to realize my passion for game development. Working with a team, I completed my first public game: Binary Bubbles. Now after joining IGDA, and continuing to expand my knowledge of software and game development, there is no more perfect industry for me other than software!`,
